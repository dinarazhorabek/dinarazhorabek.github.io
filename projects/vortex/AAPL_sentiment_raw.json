However, this strategy caps upside potential, leading to significant underperformance compared to broader market indices and newer, more flexible alternatives like JEPQ. While it offers consistent monthly income, its long-term capital preservation issues and inability to fully capitalize on bull markets raise questions about its suitability for total return investors.",
